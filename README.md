## ACES Metadata File (AMF) ##

The ACES Metadata File ("AMF") is a sidecar XML file intended to exchange the metadata required to recreate ACES viewing pipelines. It describes the transforms necessary to configure an ACES viewing pipeline for a collection of related image files.

This directory includes the ACES Metadata File XML Schema ([acesMetadataFile.xsd](./schema/acesMetadataFile.xsd)), dependency XML schemas and [example AMF files](./examples/).

Details of the ACES Metadata File format and its use cases can be found in [Academy Specification S-2019-001](https://aces.mp/S-2019-001).
